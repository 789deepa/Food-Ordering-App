🚀 React Food Ordering App

This project is a React-based food ordering application built while learning modern
frontend concepts like React Hooks, React Router, and component-based architecture.

✨ What I’m Learning / Using:
- React functional components
- useState & useEffect hooks
- React Router (nested routes, RouterProvider, Outlet)
- Clean folder structure
- Reusable UI components

🧠 Purpose:
- Strengthen React fundamentals
- Understand real-world app structure
- Build confidence by completing projects end-to-end

📌 Status:
- Actively under development
- More features coming soon (search, filters, API integration)
